					7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tournament Organiser may

					</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team membership may be

						preliminary rounds. For example, a player allocated to 
						a different team for the same school, [or an 
						unregistered player], may represent that team in the 
						Round 2 match in the place of a player who represented 
						that team in Round 1. </li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Team membership as of the 
						commencement of that team’s Round 3 match must consist 
						only of players who had previously represented that team
						 in either Round 1 or Round 2, including as a 
						substitute. For the avoidance of doubt, a team cannot 
						introduce a member in Round 3 who was not a part of that
						 team in either Round 1 or Round 2, but its membership 
						can be constituted of any combination of players who 
						represented that team in either Round 1 or Round 2.</li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final team membership must 
						be confirmed with the UQU before the commencement of 
						that team’s Round 3 match. Once confirmed, team 
						membership is fixed and may not be changed.</li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teams changing members in 
						breach of (c) will be deemed to have forfeited the 
						match. The team competing against the team in breach 
						will be accredited a win. </li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a team is requested by 
						the UQU to confirm final team membership, and fails to 
						do so before the commencement of that team’s Round 3 
						match, that team may be deemed ineligible for the Finals
						 Series pending confirmation of their membership.
