					Personal information may need to be disclosed to external 
					service providers engaged by us in order for those service 
					providers to fulfil their service obligations to the firm.

					<ul>
						<li>IT service providers who assist in managing our 
						servers and networks may need to access our datastores 
						in order to maintain the servers and networks, or </li>
						<li>A freight shipping provider who assists us in 
						delivering engraved trophy’s to winning teams may need 
						access to team postal addresses, or </li>
						<li>A customer support provider may need access to the 
						email addresses of users who request support. </li>
					</ul>
					<p class="card-text">We will only ever disclose as much 
					personal information as is needed to deliver the service.
					Where personal information is disclosed to an external 
					party, we will take steps to ensure that the external party
					 treats such information confidentially and in accordance
